Run time analysis (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) for each solution:

Task 0: Constant
Runtime analysis is O(1) because the run time does not change with the function of the input.

Task 1: Linear
Runtime analysis is O(2n), or simplified to O(n), because we only have to iterate once on two collections.

Task 2: Linear
Runtime analysis is O(n) because we only have to iterate through the calls once to find the longest one.

Task 3: Linear
Runtime analysis simplifies to O(n), because iteration has O(n) complexity.

Task 4: Linear
Runtime analysis simplifies to O(n), because each method has one non-nested for loop inside and the iteration has O(n) complexity.
