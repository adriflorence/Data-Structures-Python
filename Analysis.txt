Run time analysis (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) for each solution:

Task 0: Constant
Runtime analysis is O(1) because the run time does not change with the function of the input.

Task 1: Linear
Runtime analysis is O(n) because we only have to iterate once on the records list.

Task 2: Linear
Runtime analysis is O(n) because we only have to iterate through the calls once.

Task 3: Linear
Runtime analysis is O(NlogN), because sort is the slowest function that has O(NlogN) complexity.

Task 4: Linear
Runtime analysis is O(NlogN), because sort is the slowest function that has O(NlogN) complexity.
